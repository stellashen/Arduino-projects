# Arduino Projects (Java for software-side)

### What is [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)?

"Arduino is an open source computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical and digital world." - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)

### What are Arduino projects like?

Check out my (short) videos for showcasing the results:
* (assignment 2) Wacky Washer: https://youtu.be/znEq2Ok1cGc
* (assignment 3) Cricket: https://youtu.be/2rSaBHr3UU8
* (assignment 6) Pixel Display: https://youtu.be/vTESHyECGiw
* (assignment 8 & 9) Fitbit Clone: https://youtu.be/2oosXBeFeDw

The **instructions** directory contains instructions for these projects.

Arduino & Java code for these projects is in the corresponding assignments directories (e.g. /assignments/assign6  for Pixel Display code).

Assignment 5 is Morse Coder (coded with Arduino & Java). I didn't record a video for it. But it's an important project too, especially if you want to practice getting input & output with Arduino.

Washer, Cricket, and Pixel Display are very straightforward basic Arduino projects. Morse coder and Fitbit clone are a little bit more complicated, and part of them are written in Java, so in these projects you come to see how the hardware and software interact.

### More projects...

The studios directory contains my in-class projects. They cover basic concepts & implementations of Arduino projects, such as circuits, debouncing, input/output stream, and program control (in Assembly).
